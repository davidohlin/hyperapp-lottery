# hyperapp-lottery
> A lottery in hyperapp. [Demo here](http://lottery.surge.sh)


## Why

I wanted to try out [hyperapp](https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp) and also my [boilerplate](https://github.com/davidohlin/create-hyperapp).

## Installation

Clone repository and install dependencies:

```sh
$ npm install
```

## Development

```sh
$ npm run start
```

And go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) :tada:


## Issues

Animations are triggered every time the applications state is changed. I will fix that as soon as [this](https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp/pull/290) is fixed.
